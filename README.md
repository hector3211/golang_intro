## Description

In this folder are a bunch of golang project I have built learning go, it has
become one of my favorites when it comes to languages.

# highlights

1. fiber
   - Built a rest Api using fiber which is familiar coming from js express framework
2. go_postgres
   - Here I used gin for my backend Api solution with the help of go's gorm (an ORM for go) and postgres
3. requests
   - In this one I'm using gin and go's built in request libary for external Api requests
